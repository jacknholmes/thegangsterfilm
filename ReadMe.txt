Summary:

Gangster films have been a staple of Hollywood sine the early 20th century, captivating audiences with tales of organized crime, complex characters and moral ambiguity. While for years some of my favorite films  have been within this genre, I came to learn far more about its history, characters, and its social and political implications in a Film Genres class at the School of Cinematic Arts this semester. This interactive website is my attempt at digitally expressing some of my favorite gangster films and the fascinating facts surrounding them. It has been a lot of fun creating this website and finding a new, unique way to engage with this genre. 

Interactions:
	•	The site opens with an entry page, which serves a few purposes: 
	⁃	It provides an introduction to the genre and explains the motivations behind the site
	⁃	It instructs users how to move about the site 
	⁃	As I was building the page, I noticed that Chrome was blocking the playing of audio when hovering over the posters before an initial user interaction. To solve this, I decided to include an entry button that forces users to click on and interact with the page before even reaching the posters, ensuring the audio would be played every time they were hovered over

	•	Two rows of three movie posters sit in the center of the screen. Each poster has lightbulbs around it, and when hovered over, these lightbulbs light up, creating the image of a movie marquee seen outside of theaters

	•	Similarly, when the posters are hovered over, an iconic audio clip plays from that specific film. The audio bytes for each film are: 
	⁃	The Godfather: Vito Corleone saying “I’m gonna make him an offer he can’t refuse”
	⁃	The Godfather Pt. 2: Michael Corleone saying “I know it was you Fredo. You broke my heart” 
	⁃	A Bronx Tale: Lorenzo saying “You can be anything you wanna be. Remember, the saddest thing in life is wasted talent”
	⁃	Casino: Ace Rothstein saying “In Vegas, everybody’s gotta watch everybody else”
	⁃	Goodfellas: Henry Hill saying “As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster”
	⁃	Scarface: Tony Montana saying “Say hello to my little friend” 

	•	These films can be further explored through click functions. For 5 of the 6 posters, these click functions cause a modal to appear that presents an interesting in-depth fact about each film, along with an accompanying video or image(s). The information/media modal for each film is: 
	⁃	The Godfather: A paragraph explaining the real-life New York City mafia’s influence on the film’s production, with a clip from the TV series “The Offer” that depicts this event
	⁃	The Godfather Pt. 2: A paragraph explaining the differences Vito and Michael Corleone have in their approaches to operating the Corleone crime family, accompanied by a photo of the two together
	⁃	A Bronx Tale: A paragraph explaining how the film was the first directed by Robert De Niro, and how he’s one of the most popular figures of the genre, accompanied by 6 images of different roles De Niro has played in gangster films. When hovered over, a caption slides up over these images naming the film from which they come from
	⁃	Goodfellas: A paragraph explaining director Martin Scorsese’s documentary-like approach, accompanied by a clip from the film that displays this approach
	⁃	Scarface: An explanation of the political undertones present in the film, accompanied by a video of the film’s opening scene which contains documentary footage of the Mariel Boatlift from Cuba to the United States
	•	Each of these modals has a symbol unique to that film as its close button, as opposed to a simple “x.” The close buttons for each film are: 
	⁃	The Godfather: An orange — In the film, the presence of oranges indicates that an on-screen death is imminent 
	⁃	The Godfather Pt. 2: The puppeteer hand logo from The Godfather Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 title card — this logo symbolizes the power and behind-the-scenes control that the depicted mobsters have
	⁃	A Bronx Tale: A Yankee hat — a staple of the wardrobe of Calogero, the film’s main character
	⁃	Goodfellas: A revolver — a self-explanatory symbol of the gangster genre
	⁃	Scarface: A blimp — in one of the film’s most iconic scenes, Tony Montana looks to the sky and sees a blimp that reads a phrase that becomes his motto, “the world is yours”
	•	Casino is the only film that doesn’t have a modal pop-up. I opted for a bit more visually exciting choice for this poster through the use of an animation function — when clicked, cards, dice, poker chips and cash animate out from behind the poster, and when clicked again, they return to their original position. This was a fun way to include some iconography of the film within the webpage 

	•	The features included in my webpage are: 
	⁃	.mouseenter/.mouseleave
	⁃	.click 
	⁃	.get(0).play
	⁃	.animate
	⁃	.slidetoggle
